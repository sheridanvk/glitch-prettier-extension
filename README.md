Chrome extension to use Prettier with Glitch
=========================

Install the extension by heading [here](https://glitch-prettier-extension.glitch.me/) and downloading it.

TODO:
- Make this check to see what the file format is (currently it's assuming JS)
- Preserve cursor position (formatWithCursor) so it stay in the same place after formatting
- Test this on non-Glitch pages
- Remove jQuery, we're not using it
- Fix the icons (sparkle emoji logo?)
- Get it hosted in the Chrome extension store
- Ping the support forum about it (e.g. https://support.glitch.com/t/how-to-beautify-prettify-the-text/2168/5)
